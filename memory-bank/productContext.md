# Product Context

*   **Problem Solved:** Traditional build systems can be slow, require manual versioning, and struggle with reproducibility across different environments. Leeway addresses this by providing a fast, automated, and reliable build process specifically for Go, Yarn, and Docker projects. It eliminates manual versioning by using content-based hashing and speeds up builds through aggressive local and remote caching and parallel execution.
*   **How it Works:** Leeway operates on a three-level structure: Workspace, Components, and Packages. It analyzes source files, dependencies (`BUILD.yaml`, `go.mod`, `yarn.lock`, etc.), and configuration (`WORKSPACE.yaml`) to compute unique, content-based versions for each package. It builds packages in isolation, manages dependencies, and utilizes local and remote caches (GCS/S3) to avoid redundant work. Builds are parallelized based on the dependency graph. It offers specific configurations for Go, Yarn, and Docker package types, along with generic packages and executable scripts. Build arguments allow for parameterization.
*   **User Experience Goals:** Provide a seamless and efficient build experience for developers. Offer a clear and powerful CLI for inspecting the workspace, managing builds, and understanding dependencies. Ensure builds are fast and reproducible. Simplify the setup and configuration for supported project types.
