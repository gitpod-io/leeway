# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Initializing the memory bank based on the project's `README.md`.
*   **Recent Changes:**
    *   Created the `memory-bank` directory.
    *   Created core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
    *   Populated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` with initial content derived from `README.md`.
    *   Updated `techContext.md` with information about Leeway's GitHub Actions integration.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Continue exploring and documenting Leeway's CI/CD integration capabilities.
    *   Populate `systemPatterns.md` with architecture details from `README.md`.
    *   Populate `progress.md` with the initial project state.
*   **Active Decisions:** Using the `README.md` as the primary source for initial memory bank population, supplemented by code analysis for specific features.
*   **Patterns & Preferences:** Following the structure defined in `.clinerules/memory-bank.md`.
*   **Learnings & Insights:** 
    *   The `README.md` provides a good overview of the project's purpose, structure, and core features (build system, caching, supported languages, CLI).
    *   Leeway has built-in GitHub Actions integration via the `--report-github` flag, which writes build success/failure status to GitHub Actions outputs using the format `{pkg.FilesystemSafeName()}={success}`.
    *   The `FilesystemSafeName()` function converts component:package format to component--package (e.g., `backend:docker` becomes `backend--docker`).
    *   Currently, Leeway only reports boolean success/failure values to GitHub Actions, not other build artifacts or metadata.
